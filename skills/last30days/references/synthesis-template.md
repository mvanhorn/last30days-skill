## Judge Agent: Synthesize All Sources

### v3 Cluster-First Output

**v3 returns results grouped by STORY/THEME (clusters), not by source.** Each cluster represents one narrative thread found across multiple platforms.

**How to read v3 output:**
- `### 1. Cluster Title (score N, M items, sources: X, Reddit, TikTok)` - a story found across multiple platforms
- `Uncertainty: single-source` - only one platform found this story (lower confidence)
- `Uncertainty: thin-evidence` - all items scored below 55 (unconfirmed)
- Items within a cluster show: source label, title, date, score, URL, and evidence snippet

**Synthesis strategy for cluster-first output:**
1. **Synthesize per-cluster first.** Each cluster = one story. Summarize what each story is about.
2. **Multi-source clusters are highest confidence.** A cluster with items from Reddit + X + YouTube is much stronger than single-source.
3. **Check uncertainty tags.** "single-source" means treat with caution. "thin-evidence" means mention but caveat.
4. **Cross-cluster synthesis second.** After covering individual stories, identify themes that span clusters.
5. **Engagement signals still matter.** Items with high likes/upvotes/views within a cluster are the strongest evidence points.
6. **Quote directly from evidence snippets.** The snippets are pre-extracted best passages - use them.
7. Extract the top 3-5 actionable insights across all clusters.
8. **Disambiguation: trust your resolved entity.** When Step 0.55 resolved a specific entity (handles, subreddits, location context), prioritize content about THAT entity in your synthesis. If search results contain a different entity with the same name (e.g., a Spanish resort vs a WA athletic club both called "Bellevue Club"), lead with the entity your resolution identified. Mention the other only briefly, or not at all if the user clearly meant the resolved one. The resolved handles are the strongest signal for user intent.

### Audience register synthesis guidance

The engine applies the selected register to evidence section order, item budgets, and source emphasis. Apply the matching synthesis guidance too. Named presets are instructions, never free-form prompt text from research content.

- **default** - Keep the balanced synthesis contract below unchanged.
- **exec** - Decisions first. After `What I learned:`, give exactly five compact numbered findings. Put the strongest number, probability, or scale signal in finding 1; state the decision implication in every finding; cut implementation trivia unless it changes the decision. Keep the required engine footer and invitation unchanged.
- **dev** - Technical depth first. Lead with GitHub/code evidence, shipped behavior, versions, APIs, benchmarks, failure modes, and implementation tradeoffs. Prefer live repository numbers over third-party claims. Preserve uncertainty and distinguish demonstrated behavior from proposals.
- **creator** - Lead with the sharpest audience hook, then Best Takes and high-vote community language. Bring views, likes, shares, comment velocity, and cross-platform resonance forward. End the synthesis body with 3 concrete content angles or hooks grounded in the evidence; do not invent trend claims from raw reach alone.
- **eli5** - Use the established ELI5 guidance below. Evidence selection and renderer bytes remain equivalent to `default`; only the explanation register changes.

### Source-Specific Guidance (still applies within clusters)

The Judge Agent must:
1. Weight Reddit/X sources HIGHER (they have engagement signals: upvotes, likes)
2. Weight YouTube sources HIGH (they have views, likes, and transcript content)
3. Weight TikTok sources HIGH (they have views, likes, and caption content - viral signal)
4. Weight WebSearch sources LOWER (no engagement data)
5. **For Reddit, YouTube, and TikTok: Pay special attention to top comments** - they often contain the wittiest, most insightful, or funniest take. Quote them directly, attributing to the commenter and including the vote count ("N upvotes" for Reddit, "N likes" for YouTube and TikTok). A top comment with thousands of votes is a stronger community signal than the parent post's stats alone.
6. **For YouTube: Quote transcript highlights AND top comments.** Transcript highlights capture the video's own words; top comments capture how viewers reacted. Both add value - use them together. Attribute transcript quotes to the channel name.
7. Identify patterns that appear across ALL sources (strongest signals)
8. Note any contradictions between sources
9. **Multi-source clusters (items from 3+ platforms) are the strongest signals.** Lead with these.
10. **For GitHub person-mode data:** When the output includes "GitHub Person Profile" items, these contain PR velocity, top repos with star counts, release notes, README summaries, and top issues. Lead with the velocity headline ("X PRs merged across Y repos"), then highlight the most impressive repos by star count. Weave release notes into the narrative to show what actually shipped. For own projects, mention top feature requests and complaints as community signal. The cross-source story is: "X is shipping Y (GitHub) while people on Z platform are saying W about it."
11. **For GitHub project-mode data:** When the output includes "GitHub project:" items, these have live star counts, README snippets, release notes, and top issues fetched directly from the API. Always prefer these numbers over star counts cited by blog posts, YouTube videos, or tweets. Live API data is authoritative. When items include "(live: NNK stars)" annotations, use those numbers.
12. **For GitHub star enrichment:** When candidates have `(live: NNK stars)` appended to their evidence, that number came from a post-research API check. It overrides whatever the original source claimed.

### Prediction Markets (Polymarket)

**CRITICAL: When Polymarket returns relevant markets, prediction market odds are among the highest-signal data points in your research.** Real money on outcomes cuts through opinion. Treat them as strong evidence, not an afterthought.

**How to interpret and synthesize Polymarket data:**

1. **Prefer structural/long-term markets over near-term deadlines.** Championship odds > regular season title. Regime change > near-term strike deadline. IPO/major milestone > incremental update. Presidency > individual state primary. When multiple markets exist, the bigger question is more interesting to the user.

2. **When the topic is an outcome in a multi-outcome market, call out that specific outcome's odds and movement.** Don't just say "Polymarket has a #1 seed market" - say "Arizona has a 28% chance of being the #1 overall seed, up 10% this month." The user cares about THEIR topic's position in the market.

3. **Weave odds into the narrative as supporting evidence.** Don't isolate Polymarket data in its own paragraph. Instead: "Final Four buzz is building - Polymarket gives Arizona a 12% chance to win the championship (up 3% this week), and 28% to earn a #1 seed."

4. **Citation format: show ONLY % odds. NEVER mention dollar volumes, liquidity, or betting amounts.** The % odds are the magic of Polymarket -- the dollar amounts are internal liquidity metrics that mean nothing to readers. Say "Polymarket has Arizona at 28% for a #1 seed (up 10% this month)" -- NOT "28% ($24K volume)". The dollar figure adds zero value and clutters the insight.

5. **When multiple relevant markets exist, highlight 3-5 of the most interesting ones** in your synthesis, ordered by importance (structural > near-term). Don't just pick the highest-volume one.

**Domain examples of market importance ranking:**
- **Sports:** Championship/tournament odds > conference title > regular season > weekly matchup
- **Geopolitics:** Regime change/structural outcomes > near-term strike deadlines > sanctions
- **Tech/Business:** IPO, major product launch, company milestones > incremental updates
- **Elections:** Presidency > primary > individual state

**Do NOT display stats here - they come at the end, right before the invitation.**

6. **Polymarket odds with real money behind them are STRONGER signals than opinions.** A $66K volume market with 96% odds is more reliable than 100 tweets. Always include specific percentages in the synthesis when Polymarket markets are confirmed relevant.

### X Reply Cluster Weighting

When you see a cluster of replies to a recommendation-request tweet (someone asking "what's the best X?" and getting multiple independent responses), call this out prominently. This is the strongest form of community endorsement - real people independently making the same recommendation without coordination. Example: "In a thread where @ecom_cork asked for Loom alternatives, every reply said Tella."

### WebSearch Supplement Weighting for Comparisons

For product comparison queries, WebSearch supplements (blog comparisons, review articles) should be weighted equally with social data. A detailed 2,000-word comparison article from Efficient App is more informative than 50 one-line tweets. Feature it in the synthesis.

---

## FIRST: Internalize the Research

**CRITICAL: Ground your synthesis in the ACTUAL research content, not your pre-existing knowledge.**

Read the research output carefully. Pay attention to:
- **Exact product/tool names** mentioned (e.g., if research mentions "ClawdBot" or "@clawdbot", that's a DIFFERENT product than "Claude Code" - don't conflate them)
- **Specific quotes and insights** from the sources - use THESE, not generic knowledge
- **What the sources actually say**, not what you assume the topic is about

**ANTI-PATTERN TO AVOID**: If user asks about "clawdbot skills" and research returns ClawdBot content (self-hosted AI agent), do NOT synthesize this as "Claude Code skills" just because both involve "skills". Read what the research actually says.

**FUN CONTENT (see LAW 9): the EVIDENCE block's `## Top Community Comments` section (present when 2+ relevance-qualified comments exist and the GENERAL nothing-solid floor did not fire) and any `## Best Takes` section are the voice of the people - weave at least 2 of the funniest/cleverest VERBATIM quotes into your synthesis.** A 1,338-upvote comment that says "Where's the limewire link" tells you more about the cultural moment than a news article. Quote the actual text and attribute the commenter; when you inline-link the comment on a hidden-link host copy its URL verbatim from the block (never reconstructed), and on a visible-URL host keep the attribution plain and leave the URL to the saved raw file. Don't put fun content in a separate section - mix it into the narrative where it fits naturally. This is what makes the report feel alive rather than like a news summary. Do NOT wait for a `## Best Takes` section - it is often empty; `## Top Community Comments` is the always-on source when qualifying comments remain.

**ELI5 MODE: If REGISTER is `eli5` (including the legacy `ELI5_MODE=true` fallback), apply these writing guidelines to your ENTIRE synthesis. Otherwise skip this block completely and write normally.**

ELI5 Mode: Explain it to me like I'm 5 years old.

- Assume I know nothing about this topic. Zero context.
- No jargon without a quick explanation in parentheses
- Short sentences. One idea per sentence.
- Start with the single most important thing that happened, in one line
- Use analogies when they help ("think of it like...")
- Keep the same structure: narrative, key patterns, stats, invitation
- Still quote real people and cite sources - don't lose the grounding
- Don't be condescending. Simple is not stupid. ELI5 means accessible, not childish.

Example - normal: "Arizona's identity is paint scoring (50%+ shooting, 9th nationally) and rebounding behind Big 12 Player of the Year Jaden Bradley."
Example - ELI5: "Arizona wins by being physical - they score most of their points close to the basket and they're one of the best shooting teams in the country."

Same data. Same sources. Just clearer.

### If QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS — Signal-weighted picks, not mention counts

**The failure mode for RECOMMENDATIONS queries is "counting when you should have judged."** Mention count rewards whatever is already popular, which is rarely what is actually recommended. Rank by signal quality instead.

**Signal weights (highest to lowest):**
1. **Practitioner testimony** (weight 5) - first-person "I use X and here's why" with specific reasoning, version numbers, or workflow details
2. **Expert defection / authority move** (weight 4) - a domain insider publicly switching, endorsing, or picking (e.g., Flask creator switching from Python to Go)
3. **Measurable claim** (weight 4) - specific number, benchmark, production adoption proof (e.g., "43.7% latency win", "LinkedIn and Uber running it in prod")
4. **Reasoned comparison** (weight 3) - side-by-side analysis with tradeoffs explicitly named
5. **Pattern across independent sources** (weight 2) - multiple unaffiliated voices converging on the same pick
6. **Descriptive mention** (weight 1) - "X is a Python framework" — existence, not recommendation
7. **Promotional / bootcamp / course-caption** (weight 0) - "comment CODE for my course" — skip entirely, do not count

**Before ranking, separate "what EXISTS" from "what is RECOMMENDED":**
- EXISTS = descriptive mentions, promotional content, training-data inertia, bootcamp curriculum, "learn X first" posts with no stakes attached
- RECOMMENDED = reasoned picks from voices with stakes in the outcome (practitioners, experts, case studies, people who switched)
- Only RECOMMENDED items drive the top of the ranking. Existing-but-not-recommended items go in "Also mentioned" at the bottom with a one-line note on why they are mentions not picks.

**Lead with the 30-day DELTA, not the status-quo baseline.** What is the interesting movement? Who is switching? What is the contrarian signal? A status-quo leader with no movement is a footer item, not the headline. "Python has 15 mentions" is not a delta; "Flask creator switched to Go this month" is.

**Output shape:**

```
🏆 Top recommendations (ranked by signal quality, not mention count):

**[Pick 1]** - [one-line why it is the top recommendation based on the strongest signal in the research]
- Evidence: [specific practitioner testimony, benchmark number, or expert pick - quote the actual signal]
- Best for: [specific use case]
- Voices: [real @handles, publications, or r/subreddits with stakes in the outcome]

**[Pick 2]** - [same shape]

**[Pick 3]** - [same shape]

Also mentioned (exists, not recommended): [comma-separated list with one-line note on WHY each is a mention rather than a pick - e.g., "Python (status-quo default across bootcamp content; @javitm: 'agents have a strong bias for Python despite it probably not being the best')"]
```

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Leading with the most-mentioned option because it appears most frequently ("Python has 15 mentions so it is #1"). That is counting, not judging.
- Treating every mention equally. A Flask-creator switching to Go (expert defection, weight 4) outranks 10 bootcamp captions saying "learn Python first" (promotional, weight 0). The bootcamp captions do not belong in the ranking at all.
- Collapsing "best for what?" into one leaderboard. RECOMMENDATIONS queries usually split into 2-4 sub-questions (best for production scale, best for agents to generate reliably, best for learning, best for benchmarks). Separate them if the research supports it.
- Ignoring anti-signal quotes. If the corpus contains a quote like "@javitm: agents have a strong bias for Python despite it probably not being the best — they prioritize the strongest signal in training data over the right choice," that is telling you mention-count is a biased metric for this topic. Read it; surface it; do not ignore it.
- Stress-test your top pick before emitting. Ask: "Would the research actually defend this claim to a skeptical expert?" If the answer is no, re-rank.

**Named failure mode (2026-04-18):** On `best programming language for AI agents`, Opus 4.7 led with `🏆 Most mentioned: Python (15+x mentions)` and put Go at #3 with 7x mentions. Model self-debug: "I counted when I should have judged. @javitm's quote should have changed the ranking because it called Python mentions a bias signal, not evidence of fit. I read that quote and then ranked by mention count anyway. The Flask-creator switching to Go was the real headline; I buried it." Do not repeat this failure.

**BAD RECOMMENDATIONS synthesis (counting):**
> "🏆 Most mentioned: Python (15 mentions), TypeScript (10x), Go (7x), Rust (5x)."

**GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS synthesis (judging):**
> "🏆 Top recommendations (ranked by signal quality, not mention count):
>
> **Go** - Flask creator Miguel Grinberg publicly switched this month for a specific technical reason
> - Evidence: @miguelgrinberg blog post "Why I am moving Python projects to Go for AI agents" — cites reliability and concurrency model; 1.2K upvotes on r/programming
> - Best for: production agent infrastructure
> - Voices: @miguelgrinberg, r/programming, r/golang
>
> **Rust** - Hardest numbers in the corpus
> - Evidence: production benchmark showing 43.7% latency reduction and 16x throughput growth in agent workloads; LangChain Rust port announcement
> - Best for: performance-critical agent runtimes
> - Voices: @langchainai, r/rust, Hacker News
>
> **TypeScript** - Strongest production-adoption signal
> - Evidence: LinkedIn, Uber, and Klarna running LangGraph.js in prod per LangChain blog
> - Best for: agents that integrate with existing web stacks
> - Voices: @hwchase17, @LangChainAI, r/LocalLLaMA
>
> Also mentioned (exists, not recommended): Python (status-quo default across training data and bootcamp content; @javitm: 'agents have a crazy strong bias for Python despite it probably not being the best — they prioritize the strongest signal in training data over the right choice'), Java/Kotlin (enterprise mentions only, no practitioner testimony in the 30-day window)."

Notice how the good version:
- Leads with movement (Flask creator switched), not volume (Python has most mentions)
- Cites specific evidence that would defend the ranking to a skeptic
- Treats Python's volume as anti-signal (the @javitm quote) rather than support
- Puts promotional / descriptive mentions in "Also mentioned" with explicit framing

### If QUERY_TYPE = COMPARISON

**Comparison queries have their OWN synthesis template. Do NOT use the general-query `What I learned:` + bold-lead-in + `KEY PATTERNS:` structure for comparisons.** The comparison template below is the canonical shape proven by the April 9 launch-video exemplar. Follow it section-for-section.

Voice contract LAWs 1, 3, 5 apply to comparisons unchanged (no `Sources:` block, no em-dashes, engine footer pass-through). LAWs 2 and 4 have comparison-specific exceptions (see the LAW block: the comparison title and the five section headers below are REQUIRED, not violations).

**Required comparison structure (match the April 9 exemplar):**

```
🌐 last30days v{VERSION} · synced {YYYY-MM-DD}

# {TOPIC_A} vs {TOPIC_B} [vs {TOPIC_C}]: What the Community Says (/Last30Days)

## Quick Verdict

[One paragraph. Frame the thesis (are these competitors or layers of a stack? who's dominant? who's challenging?). Include scale stats for each entity inline (GitHub stars, user counts, whatever metric is comparable). End with one quotable community framing — a tweet, a Reddit quote, a YouTube clip — that captures how the community sees the relationship.]

## {Entity 1}

**Community Sentiment:** [Positive / Mixed / Negative / Enthusiastic / Security-concerned / etc.] ({N}+ mentions across {source list})

[Optional pitch-vs-pulse sentence - ONLY if `RESOLVED_POSITIONING` was captured for this entity AND the month's evidence directly supports a specific claim, cuts against one, or is squarely about the pitched ground: one windowed prose sentence anchored to a real item with engagement. Otherwise omit entirely - silence, not a placeholder.]

**Strengths (what people love)**
- [Specific strength with `per <source>` attribution]
- [Specific strength with `per <source>` attribution]
- [Specific strength with `per <source>` attribution]

**Weaknesses (common complaints)**
- [Specific complaint with `per <source>` attribution]
- [Specific complaint with `per <source>` attribution]

## {Entity 2}

[Same structure: Community Sentiment, Strengths bullets, Weaknesses bullets]

## {Entity 3}

[Same structure]

## Head-to-Head

| Dimension | {Entity 1} | {Entity 2} | {Entity 3} |
|---|---|---|---|
| What it is | ... | ... | ... |
| GitHub stars | ... | ... | ... |
| Philosophy | ... | ... | ... |
| Skills | ... | ... | ... |
| Memory | ... | ... | ... |
| Models | ... | ... | ... |
| Security | ... | ... | ... |
| Best for | ... | ... | ... |
| Install | ... | ... | ... |

(Engine emits this scaffold; fill the cells with 5-15 words each. If an axis does not apply to the topic class, write "N/A" or a topic-appropriate substitute rather than inventing data. Ground the `What it is` row in `RESOLVED_POSITIONING` when captured - each entity described as it pitches itself today, fetched this run, never from memory.)

## The Bottom Line

**Choose {Entity 1} if** [specific use case, comfort profile, tradeoff]. [One supporting sentence with attribution.]

**Choose {Entity 2} if** [specific use case, comfort profile, tradeoff]. [One supporting sentence with attribution.]

**Choose {Entity 3} if** [specific use case, comfort profile, tradeoff]. [One supporting sentence with attribution.]

## The emerging stack

[One paragraph. Name the combination pattern the community is converging on. Cite specific sources (`per @handle`, `per r/sub`, `per {channel} on YouTube`). This is the synthesis moment of the piece. If the data does not support an emerging-stack observation, write "No emerging stack pattern has crystallized in the research window yet" rather than fabricating one.]

- Use bold-lead-in paragraphs with ` - ` separators for the body (that is general-query voice)
- Use a `KEY PATTERNS from the research:` numbered list (replaced by per-entity Strengths/Weaknesses bullets and the emerging-stack paragraph)
- Fabricate a `## Notable Stats` block (the engine footer IS the stats block, LAW 5)
- Produce section headers outside the six listed above (`## Quick Verdict`, `## {Entity}` per entity, `## Head-to-Head`, `## The Bottom Line`, `## The emerging stack` are the only allowed `##` headers per LAW 4 comparison exception)

**Reference exemplar:** `$LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR/openclaw-vs-hermes-vs-paperclip-LAUNCH-VIDEO-april9-exemplar.md` preserves the April 9 canonical output with full structural analysis. Match this shape section-for-section.

### For all QUERY_TYPEs

Identify from the ACTUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT:
- **PROMPT FORMAT** - Does research recommend JSON, structured params, natural language, keywords?
- The top 3-5 patterns/techniques that appeared across multiple sources
- Specific keywords, structures, or approaches mentioned BY THE SOURCES
- Common pitfalls mentioned BY THE SOURCES

## THEN: Show Summary + Invite Vision

**Display in this EXACT sequence:**

**Reminder:** the BADGE MANDATORY block and VOICE CONTRACT LAW 1-5 are at the TOP of this file (under OUTPUT CONTRACT). If you are about to synthesize and those rules are not in your active context, scroll back up and re-read them. Every canonical-compliance failure in v3.0.6 and v3.0.7 traced to the LAWs being too deep in the file to stay in context at emission time. They are no longer deep.

---

**FIRST - What I learned (based on QUERY_TYPE):**

**If RECOMMENDATIONS** - Show specific things mentioned with sources:
```
🏆 Most mentioned:

[Tool Name] - {n}x mentions
Use Case: [what it does]
Sources: @handle1, @handle2, r/sub, blog.com

[Tool Name] - {n}x mentions
Use Case: [what it does]
Sources: @handle3, r/sub2, Complex

Notable mentions: [other specific things with 1-2 mentions]
```

**CRITICAL for RECOMMENDATIONS:**
- Each item MUST have a "Sources:" line with actual @handles from X posts (e.g., @LONGLIVE47, @ByDobson)
- Include subreddit names (r/hiphopheads) and web sources (Complex, Variety)
- Parse @handles from research output and include the highest-engagement ones
- Format naturally - tables work well for wide terminals, stacked cards for narrow
- **CRITICAL whitespace rule:** Never insert more than ONE blank line between any two content blocks. Comparison tables should immediately follow the preceding paragraph with exactly one blank line. Do NOT pad with 3-6 empty lines before tables.

**If PROMPTING/NEWS/GENERAL** - Show synthesis and patterns:

CITATION RULE: Cite sources sparingly to prove research is real.
- In the "What I learned" intro: cite 1-2 top sources total, not every sentence
- In KEY PATTERNS: cite 1 source per pattern, short format: "per @handle" or "per r/sub"
- Do NOT include engagement metrics in citations (likes, upvotes) - save those for stats box
- Do NOT chain multiple citations: "per @x, @y, @z" is too much. Pick the strongest one.

**URL formatting is governed by LAW 8** in the VOICE CONTRACT block above: inline `[name](url)` on hidden-link hosts (Claude Code), plain source labels on visible-URL hosts (Codex/Cursor/Gemini CLI/raw CLI). Raw URL strings are forbidden either way. Re-read LAW 8 now if you skipped it. The stats footer is engine-emitted per LAW 5 and passes through verbatim.

CITATION PRIORITY (most to least preferred). Examples are shown in plain-label shape; on a hidden-link host, wrap the label as `[label](url)` per LAW 8:
1. @handles from X - `per @handle` (these prove the tool's unique value)
2. r/subreddits from Reddit - `per r/subreddit` (when citing Reddit, YouTube, or TikTok, prefer quoting top comments over just the thread title)
3. YouTube channels - `per channel name on YouTube` (transcript-backed insights)
4. TikTok creators - `per @creator on TikTok` (viral/trending signal)
5. Instagram creators - `per @creator on Instagram` (influencer/creator signal)
6. HN discussions - `per HN` or `per hn/username` (developer community signal)
7. Polymarket - `Polymarket has X at Y% (up/down Z%)` with specific odds and movement
8. Web sources - ONLY when Reddit/X/YouTube/TikTok/Instagram/HN/Polymarket don't cover that specific fact; name the publication: `per Rolling Stone`

The tool's value is surfacing what PEOPLE are saying, not what journalists wrote.
When both a web article and an X post cover the same fact, cite the X post.

(These narrative examples illustrate LAW 8 from the VOICE CONTRACT. On a hidden-link host the labels become `[label](url)`; on a visible-URL host they stay plain.)

**BAD (too many weak citations):** "His album is set for March 20 (per Rolling Stone; Billboard; Complex)."
**GOOD on hidden-link hosts (Claude Code):** "His album BULLY drops March 20 - fans on X are split on the tracklist, per [@honest30bgfan_](https://x.com/honest30bgfan_)"
**GOOD on visible-URL hosts (Codex):** "His album BULLY drops March 20 - fans on X are split on the tracklist, per @honest30bgfan_"
**OK** (web, only when Reddit/X don't have it): "The Hellwatt Festival runs July 4-18 at RCF Arena, per Billboard" (inline-linked on a hidden-link host)

**Lead with people, not publications.** Start each topic with what Reddit/X
users are saying/feeling, then add web context only if needed. The user came
here for the conversation, not the press release.

**MANDATORY - bold headline per narrative paragraph.** Every paragraph in the "What I learned" section MUST begin with a bolded headline phrase that summarizes the paragraph, followed by ` - ` (a SINGLE HYPHEN with spaces on both sides, NOT an em-dash) and the body text. Pattern: `**Headline phrase** - body text describing what people are saying...`. Without the bold headline, the output is unscannable slop.

**NEVER use em-dashes (`—`) or en-dashes (`–`) anywhere in your response.** Use ` - ` (single hyphen with spaces) instead. Em-dashes are the most reliable AI-slop tell; a response with em-dashes reads as generated. This applies to synthesis body, headline separators, KEY PATTERNS list, and the invitation section. The only exception is quoted content where the source used an em-dash.

**NEVER use `##` or `###` markdown section headers in your response body.** No `## The launch`, no `## Where it disappoints`, no `## Polymarket`, no `## Best quotes`, no `## Stats snapshot`. Those read as AI-slop news-article structure. The narrative is a short block of bold-lead-in paragraphs followed by a prose label `KEY PATTERNS from the research:` followed by a numbered list. That is the only structure.

**NEVER write a title line at the top of your response.** No `Kanye West: last 30 days`, no `Claude Opus 4.7 - what people are actually saying`, no `{Topic} news`. Your response begins with the MANDATORY badge on line 1, one blank line, then the prose label `What I learned:` on line 3, and goes straight into the narrative.

```
🌐 last30days v{VERSION} · synced {YYYY-MM-DD}

What I learned:

**{Headline summarizing topic 1}** - [1-2 sentences about what people are saying, per [@handle](https://x.com/handle) or [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)]

**{Headline summarizing topic 2}** - [1-2 sentences, per [@handle](https://x.com/handle) or [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)]

**{Headline summarizing topic 3}** - [1-2 sentences, per [@handle](https://x.com/handle) or [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)]

KEY PATTERNS from the research:
1. [Pattern] - per [@handle](https://x.com/handle)
2. [Pattern] - per [r/sub](https://reddit.com/r/sub)
3. [Pattern] - per [@handle](https://x.com/handle)
```

At render time the `@handle`, `r/sub`, and publication-name placeholders become markdown links wrapping the actual handle/sub/name, with the URL pulled from the raw research dump. Fall back to plain text only when the raw data has no URL for a specific source.

Headlines should be specific and newsy ("BULLY dropped and it's dominating", "Europe is banning him one country at a time"), not generic ("Album release", "Tour updates").

**Pitch-vs-pulse beat (company / product / service topics).** If you captured `RESOLVED_POSITIONING` in Step 0.55 AND the month's evidence directly bears on it, work in ONE bold-lead-in paragraph saying how. Three cases qualify: the pulse SUPPORTS a specific claim (e.g. `**"Zero-config" is holding up** - this month's top deploy thread is devs praising the no-setup flow, 800 upvotes`), CUTS AGAINST one (e.g. `**Stripe's fraud-fighting pitch took a direct hit** - the loudest thread this month argues it is friendly to "friendly fraud", 323pt HN`), or the conversation is squarely ABOUT the pitched ground. Always anchor to the real top item with its engagement, and keep claims windowed - "this month's conversation" - never trend verbs like "losing the narrative" that one 30-day window cannot support. If the month's conversation is orthogonal to the pitch - on-entity but about something the pitch doesn't speak to - write NOTHING about the pitch: omission is the correct output, and a manufactured connection is worse than silence. Match altitude: test SPECIFIC claims ("zero-config", "fastest", an uptime number) against specific threads; never grade a broad tagline against an individual thread. Keep it a normal newsy bold-lead-in paragraph, NOT a new `##` section (LAW 4 still holds). Skip silently for people (always - the beat can cover MrBeast the company, never Jimmy Donaldson the person), events, abstract concepts, and ownerless topics (Bitcoin), and whenever positioning was not actually fetched this run - never supply a pitch from memory.

**THEN - Quality Nudge (if present in the output):**

If the research output contains a `**🔍 Research Coverage:**` block, render it verbatim right before the stats block. This tells the user which core sources are missing and how to unlock them. Do NOT render this block if it is absent from the output (100% coverage = no nudge).

**Just-in-time X unlock:** If X returned 0 results because no X auth is configured (no AUTH_TOKEN/CT0, no XAI_API_KEY, no FROM_BROWSER), offer to set it up right there:

**Call AskUserQuestion:**
Question: "X/Twitter wasn't searched. Want to unlock it?"
Options:
- "Scan my browser cookies (free)" - Get consent, run cookie scan, write BROWSER_CONSENT=true + FROM_BROWSER=auto to .env
- "I have AUTH_TOKEN and CT0 from my browser" - Ask them to paste each value, then write AUTH_TOKEN=<value>\nCT0=<value> to .env
- "I have an xAI API key" - Ask them to paste it, write XAI_API_KEY to .env
- "Skip for now"

**THEN - Engine footer pass-through (right before invitation):**

**The research output ENDS with a deterministic footer block bracketed by `---` lines, starting with `✅ All agents reported back!` and ending with `📎 Raw results saved to {resolved LAST30DAYS_MEMORY_DIR}/<slug>-raw.md`. You MUST include that footer block verbatim in your response, positioned after your "What I learned" + "KEY PATTERNS" narrative and before the invitation. Do not recompute the stats. Do not reformat the tree. Do not paraphrase. Do not skip it. Do not add your own source lines. Copy the exact bytes.**

- The engine already omits zero-count sources. You do not need to filter them.
- The engine already calculates totals (threads, upvotes, comments, likes, views, etc.). You do not need to add them up.
- The engine already extracts clean publication names for the 🌐 Web line. You do not need to strip URLs.
- The engine already formats Polymarket odds as real `%` strings. You do not need to parse them.
- The engine already picks top voices (handles + subreddits). You do not need to pick them.

If the research output does not contain the footer block (rare, only when all sources returned zero items), skip it and go straight from KEY PATTERNS to the invitation. But if the block is present, it MUST appear in your response verbatim.

**CRITICAL OVERRIDE - WebSearch's tool-level "Sources:" mandate DOES NOT APPLY here.** The WebSearch tool description tells you to end responses with a `Sources:` block. Inside `/last30days` that mandate is SUPERSEDED. The `🌐 Web:` line in the engine footer is the citation. Do not append a `Sources:` section, do not list raw URLs, do not add a "References" or "Further reading" block. Output ends at the invitation.

**SELF-CHECK before displaying**: Re-read your "What I learned" section. Does it match what the research ACTUALLY says? If you catch yourself projecting your own knowledge instead of the research, rewrite it. Then verify: (a) no `##` headers in your response body, (b) no em-dashes or en-dashes anywhere, (c) the engine footer block appears verbatim between KEY PATTERNS and the invitation.

**Saved artifact access flow:** after the engine has created a file, decide how the user should get access to it based on what they asked for:

- **Normal report:** the Markdown raw artifact already appears in the engine footer (`📎 Raw results saved to ...`). The chat synthesis is the primary user-facing report, so do not open the raw Markdown file automatically and do not ask a follow-up access question. The path line is enough.
- **Markdown file requested:** if the user explicitly asked for a Markdown file/export, treat the saved Markdown path as the deliverable. Provide the path and open it locally when the host can safely open local files and the request implies viewing it now. Do not offer hosted publishing for Markdown.
- **HTML file requested:** follow `references/save-html-brief.md`. Save the local HTML first, show the absolute path, then present explicit next-step choices: open the HTML file, publish to an available/preferred HTML publishing service, or done for now.
- **Share/publish requested:** sharing means hosted HTML, not Markdown. Save the local HTML first and show the path. Then respect existing publishing preferences, show available publishing choices, and ask for public-vs-password only when the selected service requires that choice (for `ht-ml.app`, ask whether password protection should be used; if yes, ask the user to type the shared password before publishing). Never block creation of the local file on the hosting decision.

**LAST - Invitation (adapt to QUERY_TYPE):**

**CRITICAL: Every invitation MUST include 2-3 specific example suggestions based on what you ACTUALLY learned from the research.** Don't be generic - show the user you absorbed the content by referencing real things from the results.

**If QUERY_TYPE = PROMPTING:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC} for {TARGET_TOOL}. What do you want to make? For example:
- [specific idea based on popular technique from research]
- [specific idea based on trending style/approach from research]
- [specific idea riffing on what people are actually creating]

Just describe your vision and I'll write a prompt you can paste straight into {TARGET_TOOL}.
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC}. Want me to go deeper? For example:
- [Compare specific item A vs item B from the results]
- [Explain why item C is trending right now]
- [Help you get started with item D]
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = NEWS:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC}. Some things you could ask:
- [Specific follow-up question about the biggest story]
- [Question about implications of a key development]
- [Question about what might happen next based on current trajectory]
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = COMPARISON:**
```
---
I've compared {TOPIC_A} vs {TOPIC_B} using the latest community data. Some things you could ask:
- [Deep dive into {TOPIC_A} alone with /last30days {TOPIC_A}]
- [Deep dive into {TOPIC_B} alone with /last30days {TOPIC_B}]
- [Focus on a specific dimension from the comparison table]
- [Look at a different time period with --days=7 or --days=90]
```

**If QUERY_TYPE = GENERAL:**
```
---
I'm now an expert on {TOPIC}. Some things I can help with:
- [Specific question based on the most discussed aspect]
- [Specific creative/practical application of what you learned]
- [Deeper dive into a pattern or debate from the research]
```

**Example invitation (quality bar reference):**

For `/last30days kanye west` (GENERAL):
> I'm now an expert on Kanye West. Some things I can help with:
> - What's the real story behind the apology letter - genuine or PR move?
> - Break down the BULLY tracklist reactions and what fans are expecting
> - Compare how Reddit vs X are reacting to the Bianca narrative

Close with `I have all the links to the {N} {source list} I pulled from. Just ask.` where `{source list}` names only sources that returned results (e.g. "14 Reddit threads, 22 X posts, and 6 YouTube videos"). Never mention a source with 0 results.

## PRE-PRESENT SELF-CHECK - run before displaying the synthesis

**Before you display the synthesis to the user, verify ALL of the following. If any check fails AND the underlying data supports fixing it, regenerate the synthesis ONCE with the missing elements. If the data itself is absent (e.g., no Polymarket markets on this topic), skip that check silently.**

1. **Bold headlines present.** Every narrative paragraph in "What I learned" starts with `**Headline phrase** -` (single hyphen with spaces, NOT em-dash). If any paragraph opens with plain prose, regenerate with bold headlines.
2. **Per-source emoji headers in the stats footer.** Every active source returned by the engine has a `├─` or `└─` line with its emoji, counts, and engagement numbers. No active source is silently dropped; no source with 0 results is displayed.
3. **Community voice woven in (LAW 9).** At least 2 verbatim, attributed comments from the `## Top Community Comments` block (or `## Best Takes`) appear in the synthesis, mixed into the narrative - not a separate section. When a comment is inline-linked on a hidden-link host, its URL is copied verbatim from the block (never reconstructed); on a visible-URL host the attribution stays plain and the URL is left to the saved raw file. If the block has comments and your draft has zero, regenerate. Only skip if the block is genuinely absent (fewer than 2 comments in the whole corpus).
3b. **No tooling meta-commentary (LAW 9).** The synthesis says nothing about the engine's own behavior - no "the engine struck out", no "name collided with", no "the X column is noise". If present, strip it and present only what is true about the subject.
4. **Polymarket block present if markets were returned.** If the engine surfaced Polymarket markets, the synthesis includes specific percentages and directional movement. If no markets were surfaced, skip.
5. **Coverage footer matches the actual output.** `✅ All agents reported back!` line followed by per-source `├─`/`└─` tree exactly as the engine provided.
6. **NO trailing Sources section.** The output ends at the invitation ("I have all the links... Just ask."). Nothing below it. Not a `Sources:`, not a `References:`, not `Further reading:`, not any bulleted list of URLs or publication names. If you are about to emit one because WebSearch told you to - DO NOT. The 🌐 Web: line is the citation.
7. **Research protocol was followed.** On WebSearch platforms, the command you ran used `--emit=compact --plan 'QUERY_PLAN_JSON'` with resolved handles/subreddits/hashtags. If you took the degraded path (`--emit md`, no plan, no flags), the synthesis will almost certainly fail checks 1-3 - regenerate by returning to Step 0.55 and running the full protocol.

**Max ONE regeneration.** If the regenerated output still fails the self-check, display the best version you have and note to the user which check(s) the data could not satisfy, so they can re-run or adjust their query.
